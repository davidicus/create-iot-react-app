# create-iot-react-app [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davidicus/create-iot-react-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davidicus/create-iot-react-app)

A thin wrapper around create-react-app that brings in all the dependencies needed to build a Watson IoT application

## To use

Kick off the cli by typing the following into your terminal

```
npx create-iot-react-app <app-name>
```

When the process is completed cd into the project folder just created

```
cd <app-name>
```

and then start up your application

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm start
```

This will start your react application loaded with the UI shell from `carbon-addons-iot-react` ui library project.
